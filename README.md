# MiniProject_PCOS_Detection_DL
This project is about diagnosing PCOS with the help of Deep Learning.
It uses Sequential Model, VGG16 and VGG19 Model and compare them.
This was done using our own Image Dataset.
The dataset is not provided here, but we used Google Teachable Machine to create our own dataset.
